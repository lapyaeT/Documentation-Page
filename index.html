                <p><strong> Team Liquid</strong> is a professional team, 
                    founded in the Netherlands in 2000. Originally a Brood War clan, 
                    the team switched to StarCraft II during the SC2 Beta in 2010, 
                    and became one of the most successful western teams. 
                    On December 6, 2012, it was announced that the team had 
                    formed a Dota 2 division.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Team Liquid is also strongly associated with its website, 
                    TL.net. Launched on May 1, 2001, it has developed through 
                    the years into a focal point for StarCraft and Dota 2 coverage, 
                    eventually becoming the most-browsed StarCraft-related 
                    website in the world, gathering thousands of members 
                    (including several professional players) and centralizing 
                    news about the global SC2 scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On August 30, 2012, Teamliquid.net announced expansion into Dota 2 coverage.

                <p><strong>OG</strong> was created as the new team of former 
                    (monkey) Business players. 
                    The team's breakthrough came at the Frankfurt 
                    Major in late November, 2015. 
                    They fought through the lower bracket, defeating TI5 
                    champions Evil Geniuses and runner-ups CDEC Gaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By winning the 2017 Kiev Major, 
                    OG became the first team in Dota 2 history 
                    to win four Dota Major Championships. 
                    In <strong>August 2018,</strong>  OG became the 
                    first team to win The International from the open qualifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The grand finals of the event were the subject of 
                    a 2018 episode of "True Sight", making OG the only 
                    team to be featured in the series more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In<strong> August 2019,</strong> OG became the first 
                    team to win more than one TI by winning TI9, also becoming 
                    the first back-to-back TI winners in the history of the game.

                    After Natus Vincere and Fnatic both underperformed 
                    at The International 2014, two key members of the two 
                    organizations, Kuroky and N0tail, respectively, 
                    had an idea for a team that was run by the players, 
                    not beholden to any esports organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Kuroky</strong> brought on his friend and teammate on Na'Vi, 
                    <strong>Puppey</strong>, while N0tail brought on his friend and teammate, Fly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They rounded out their roster with Alliance midlaner s4, 
                    whose team similarly underperformed at <strong>TI4.</strong> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The roster made their public debut in the qualifiers for 
                    Star Ladder Star Series Season 10.
